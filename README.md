# Author's Note

In this project, I created a single-page Pepsi website using React and bootstrap. It's always fun building websites like these using the core stack as they allow you to strengthen the fundamentals and make them more intuitive.

## My Process

### Tools Used

Following are the tools/languages that were used to build this project:

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Custom CSS variables
- Media queries for responsiveness
- Flexbox for layout
- JavaScript (JS)
- Bootstrap
- React.js
- useState

### Challenges Faced

The major challenge for me was to make this project responsive:

- I had to add many media queries to cater to changing screen sizes. As for screen sizes greater than 768px, I wanted the layout to be similar to the standard desktop view.
- Further, more media queries were used to make this project responsive for smaller devices. It took a lot of time and effort to size and position elements precisely for dynamic screen sizes.

### Lessons Learned

Building this project was fun as throughout the entire process, I felt that I was creating something real-world and meaningful. There were two major lessons that this project taught me:

1. Dynamically updating items that are stored in a list.
2. How navigation sliders (next and previous buttons) can be made interactive using JS.
3. The power of media queries to make websites responsive for all screen sizes.

It took a decent amount of Bootstrap to style. The design was modern, and it was fun practicing media query that was required to build this project.
